# EROLA_Lab

We can create a common repository where to collect our code and our versions in ROS2 so then we can merge them in a main branch. 
That is, we can develop a different section and then merge it. 

So download the repository in main or whatever, then:
    
    git branch your_name
    
    git checkout your_name 
    
    git push --set-upstream origin your_name
